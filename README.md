#React-Securities:

##Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into React-Securities
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm start
5. The app will be served on https://localhost:8080 
   - If port 8080 is used, please use a different port number by changing the 'port' property in **webpack.config.js**
   
##Design Approaches

1. For accessing the API, I used the axios framework
2. For UI components, I used react-boostrap because it provides a vast variety of components with great looks and feel
3. For css styling, I am using inline styles for each component since there are not a lot of rules and readers would be able to spot the rules immediately in the componenet
4. Since the page does not have a lot of components, I put all the components in 1 file for easy readability and search

#Missing Piece

- I was unable to center the search bar and the pagination component using **auto** values on the **marginLeft** and **marginRight** properties
