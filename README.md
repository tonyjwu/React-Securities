#React-Securities:

##Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. cd into React-Securities
3. Run npm install
4. Run npm start
5. The app will be served on **https://localhost:8080**
   - If port 8080 is used, please use a different port number by changing the 'port' property in **webpack.config.js**
   
##Design Approaches

1. For accessing the data API, I used the axios framework because it provides a simple interface
2. For UI components, I used react-boostrap because it provides a vast variety of components with great looks and feel
3. For css styling, I used inline styles inside of each component since there aren't a lot of rules and the readers would be able to spot the rules immediately in the component
4. Since the page does not have a lot of components, I put all the components in one file for easy readability and searchability

##Missing Piece:

- Unable to center search bar and pagination component using the **auto** properties of the **marginLeft** and **marginRight** properties
